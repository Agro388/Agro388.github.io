<h2>First Appearance</h2>

<div class="section">
<h2>Character Description</h2>
<p>AB-016, known as Nova, is an anthropomorphic wolf-like stellar anomaly whose power does not naturally stabilize on its own. Unlike traditional god-tier or anomaly entities, Nova’s full potential is conditional, dependent on metaphysical recognition by higher cosmic authorities such as archangels or mythic gods.</p>
<p>Without recognition, Nova’s advanced forms manifest as unnatural and incomplete, causing instability and internal strain. While Nova possesses the framework of a deity-class entity, he is not inherently acknowledged as one—placing him in a liminal state between anomaly, protector, and unrealized god.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p><strong>Base Form:</strong> An anthropomorphic wolf with subtle star-like markings in the fur. Physically imposing but mostly grounded, with minimal anomalous emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Stellar Form (Unnatural / Unaccepted):</strong> Bright stellar fractures across the body, unstable halo structures, and partially formed wings composed of light and void. Visual intensity is high, but symmetry and control are lacking.</p>
<p><strong>Stellar Form (Accepted):</strong> Refined cosmic patterns, stable halo geometry, fully realized wings resembling constellations. Light emission becomes controlled and deliberate rather than chaotic.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> If affected by AB-014’s permanent ability disable, all forms persist visually but are non-functional.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nova is reserved, observant, and introspective. He does not seek domination, worship, or authority—only acknowledgment of existence. Rejection manifests as withdrawal and instability rather than aggression.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>Normal State (No Ability Disable)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Superhuman strength, speed, and perception</li>
    <li>Interdimensional travel</li>
    <li>Stellar energy manipulation</li>
    <li>Limited reality interaction</li>
    <li>Gradual anomalous adaptability</li>
</ul>
<h3>Form-Based Scaling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Base Form: Minimal anomaly access</li>
    <li>Unnatural Stellar Form: High output, unstable control</li>
    <li>Partially Accepted: Controlled, reliable abilities</li>
    <li>Fully Accepted: Maximum potential, perfect control</li>
</ul>
<h3>Under AB-014 Permanent Ability Disable</h3>
<p>All anomalous abilities are permanently disabled:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Interdimensional travel</li>
    <li>Reality or time manipulation</li>
    <li>Energy projection</li>
    <li>Regeneration and adaptability</li>
    <li>Dimensional or mental abilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Only physical traits remain:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enhanced strength</li>
    <li>Reflexes</li>
    <li>Durability</li>
    <li>Cosmetic form changes</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Rending Apart</h2>
<p>There is no confirmed method of bypassing AB-014’s permanent ability-disabling power. Acceptance, recognition, form evolution, or divine acknowledgment cannot restore disabled abilities once removed.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Relationship Details</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lost World Scientists: responsible for creation and initial containment; contributed to instability.</li>
    <li>Other AB Units: possible shared origin; awareness varies.</li>
    <li>Fantasy World Inhabitants: reluctant protector; feared more often than trusted.</li>
    <li>Overseer Entities / Archangels / Mythic Gods: recognition required; even one stabilizes Stellar Form.</li>
    <li>AB-014: stabilizing influence and mentor-like peer; recognition alone cannot unlock full Stellar Form.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Power ceiling is conditional, not absolute</li>
    <li>Visual intensity does not correlate with usable power</li>
    <li>Considered a failed or incomplete deity by some pantheons</li>
    <li>Acceptance affects stability, not permission to exist</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>“I don’t want worship. I want acknowledgment.”</li>
    <li>“A star doesn’t choose its sky.”</li>
    <li>“If I am unreal, why do you keep watching me?”</li>
